&lt;/h1>&lt;p>I hope to further enhance my cybersec skills, especially at the university I will be attending, in which I aspire to become the best hacking version of myself. I will pursue my self-taught adventures and projects before I attend this university. My next certification in my sights is the OSCP (aka PEN-200) from OffSec. This certification, although seen as a less complete version of CPTS, is the most recognizable and known pentesting certification on the market. I will continue to attend the CTFs in my area and hope to get the highest score I can achieve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, enough talked about myself, lets get to tutorials and knowledge on hacking all kinds of stuff!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
